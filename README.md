# Encryption & Decryption Software

Reads through a .txt file. Based on the frequencies of the characters within said file: creates a HashMap, which is then used to create a Priority Queue, which is then used to create a Huffman Tree. Takes in a user input, and encodes or decodes it using the Huffman Tree. Implemented custom and personalized data structures (w/o external libraries).
